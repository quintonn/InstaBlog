# InstaBlog
Instant Blog Creator. 

Quickly and easily create a new blog without any code or infrastructure.

# Getting Started
1. Fork this repository
2. Change the <title> meta tag in the index.html file to match your blog's name or title
3. Inside the **info** folder are files for the site's name, about page and contact page
4. The actual entries for the blog post are inside the **content** folder
5. Each blog post entry will have 2 items in this folder:
    1. An entry in the **items.json** file
    2. A folder with the same name as the **name** field in the items.json file  
       The folder name should be lower case and spaces be replaced with an underscore "_"  
       Inside this folder there should be at minimum an **index.html** file
